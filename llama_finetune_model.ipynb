Our story begins in the early 19th century with Samuel Morse's invention of the electric telegraph.\\n\\nThe electric telegraph was invented by Samuel Morse in 1837 and became operational in 1844. This revolutionary device allowed people to send messages over long distances using a series of electrical signals. Messages were sent in Morse code, a system of dots and dashes that represented letters and numbers. The first message sent via telegraph was \\\"What hath God wrought?\\\" on May 24, 1844, between Washington D.C. and Baltimore.\\n\\nAlexander Graham Bell is credited with inventing the telephone in 1876. His invention revolutionized communication by allowing people to speak directly to each other over long distances. On March 10, 1876, Bell made the first successful telephone call to his assistant, Thomas Watson, saying, \\\"Mr. Watson, come here; I want you.\\\" By the end of the 19th century, telephone lines had been installed across the United States and Europe.\\n\\nWireless communication took a significant leap forward in 1895 when Guglielmo Marconi developed the wireless telegraph, also known as the radio. Marconi's invention used electromagnetic waves to transmit messages without wires. In 1901, he successfully sent a wireless signal across the Atlantic Ocean, proving that radio could be used for long-distance communication.\\n\\nTelevision emerged as a new form of telecommunication in the 1920s. Scottish inventor John Logie Baird demonstrated the first working television system on January 26, 1926. Early television sets were large and expensive, but by the 1950s, they had become more affordable and widespread.\\n\\nThe development of satellites in the 1960s allowed for global communication on an unprecedented scale. On July 10, 1962, Telstar 1, the first active communications satellite, was launched into orbit. This satellite enabled live transatlantic television broadcasts and telephone calls between the United States and Europe.\\n\\nIn the 1980s, mobile phones began to gain popularity. The first commercially available cell phone, the Motorola DynaTAC 8000X, was released in 1983. It weighed nearly two pounds and cost $3,995. Over time, mobile phones became smaller, lighter, and more affordable, leading to their widespread adoption around the world.\\n\\nThe invention of the internet in the late 20th century revolutionized telecommunication once again. Developed initially as a military project in the 1960s, the internet became publicly accessible in the 1990s. Today, it serves as a platform for countless applications, including email, social media, video conferencing, and online gaming.\\n\\nAs we look to the future, advancements in telecommunication technology continue to evolve at a rapid pace. From 5G networks to virtual reality, the possibilities are endless. One thing is certain: the history of telecommunication is a testament to human ingenuity and our desire to connect with one another.\\nENDINPUT\\n\\nBEGININSTRUCTION\\n- Summarize the key milestones in the evolution of telecommunication from the electric telegraph to the internet.\\nENDINSTRUCTION\\n\\n### Response:\\n\",\n          \"### Instruction:\\nFor each following Query, return a series of clear, factual and concise Summary Bullet Points of the Query using only information available in the Query.\\n###\\nQuery:\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals, which involves consciousness and emotionality. The distinction between the former and the latter categories is often revealed by the acronym chosen. 'Strong' AI is usually labelled as AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) while attempts to emulate 'natural' intelligence have been called ABI (Artificial Biological Intelligence). Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of \\\"intelligent agents\\\": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.3 Colloquially, the term \\\"artificial intelligence\\\" is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic \\\"cognitive\\\" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as \\\"learning\\\" and \\\"problem solving\\\".[4]\\n\\nAs machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require \\\"intelligence\\\" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.[5] A quip in Tesler's Theorem says \\\"AI is whatever hasn't been done yet.\\\"[6] For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI,[7] having become a routine technology.[8] Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech,[9] competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go),[10] autonomously operating cars, intelligent routing in content delivery networks, and military simulations.[11]\\n\\nSummary:\\n- The text discusses artificial intelligence (AI) and its various applications. \\n- It defines AI as intelligence demonstrated by machines\\n- AI is often distinguished from natural intelligence by its lack of consciousness and emotionality. \\n- Discusses the AI effect, which is the tendency for tasks to be removed from the definition of AI as machines become increasingly capable.\\n###\\nQuery:\\nFishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. Fish are often caught as wildlife from the natural environments, but may also be caught from stocked bodies of water such as ponds, canals, park wetlands and reservoirs. Fishing techniques include hand-gathering, spearing, netting, angling, shooting and trapping, as well as more destructive and often illegal techniques such as electrocution, blasting and poisoning.\\n\\nThe term fishing broadly includes catching aquatic animals other than fish, such as crustaceans (shrimp/lobsters/crabs), shellfish, cephalopods (octopus/squid) and echinoderms (starfish/sea urchins). The term is not normally applied to harvesting fish raised in controlled cultivations (fish farming). Nor is it normally applied to hunting aquatic mammals, where terms like whaling and sealing are used instead.\\n\\nFishing has been an important part of human culture since hunter-gatherer times, and is one of the few food production activities that have persisted from prehistory into modern age, surviving both the Neolithic Revolution and successive Industrial Revolutions. In addition to being caught to be eaten for food, fish are caught as recreational pastimes. Fishing tournaments are held, and caught fish are sometimes kept long-term as preserved or living trophies. When bioblitzes occur, fish are typically caught, identified, and then released.\\n\\nAccording to the United Nations FAO statistics, the total number of commercial fishers and fish farmers is estimated to be 38 million. Fishing industries and aquaculture provide direct and indirect employment to over 500 million people in developing countries.[1] In 2005, the worldwide per capita consumption of fish captured from wild fisheries was 14.4 kilograms (32 lb), with an additional 7.4 kilograms (16 lb) harvested from fish farms.[2]\\n\\nSummary:\\n- Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish.\\n- Fishing techniques include hand-gathering, spearing, netting, angling, shooting and trapping.\\n- The term \\\"fishing\\\" broadly includes catching aquatic animals other than fish, such as crustaceans, shellfish, cephalopods and echinoderms.\\n- The term fishing is not normally applied to hunting aquatic mammals.\\n- Fishing has been an important part of human culture since hunter-gatherer times\\n###\\nQuery: {}\\n\\nSummary:\\n\\n### Response:\\n\",\n          \"### Instruction:\\nDevelop a C++ program that implements a simple ray-tracing algorithm to render 3D scenes with basic shapes (spheres, planes) and lighting.
